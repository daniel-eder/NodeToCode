## Unreal Engine Source Path

Run `Content/Scripts/detect-ue-path.sh` (Mac/Linux) or `Content\Scripts\detect-ue-path.bat` (Windows) to detect your UE installation and update this file.

UE_SOURCE_PATH: <!-- RUN DETECT SCRIPT TO POPULATE -->

This is where source files for Unreal Engine 5 can be found and searched through for research purposes. NEVER try to modify files here.

## TESTING COMPILATION

The build scripts support UE 5.4, 5.5, 5.6, and 5.7 with auto-detection of installations.

**Windows (build.ps1):**
```powershell
.\build.ps1 -UEVersion 5.5       # Build for specific version
.\build.ps1 -All                  # Build all detected versions
.\build.ps1 -WhatIf               # Preview detected UE installations
```

**Mac/Linux (build.sh):**
```bash
./build.sh -v 5.5                 # Build for specific version
./build.sh --all                  # Build all detected versions
./build.sh --whatif               # Preview detected UE installations
```

Logs are saved to `BuildLogs/Build_<version>_<timestamp>.log`. Running without arguments shows help and detected UE versions.

## Overview

NodeToCode is an Unreal Engine 5 plugin for translating Blueprints into various programming languages (C++, Python, JavaScript, C#, Swift, Pseudocode) using Large Language Models (LLMs). It integrates into the Unreal Editor, providing tools to collect Blueprint nodes, manage LLM interactions, and display generated code with syntax highlighting.

**Key Features:**
*   **Blueprint-to-Code Translation:** Converts selected Blueprint graphs/entire Blueprints.
*   **Multi-LLM Support:** Integrates with OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, DeepSeek, local Ollama instances, and LM Studio.
*   **Editor Integration:** Adds a "Node to Code" toolbar button in the Blueprint Editor for translation, JSON export, and a dedicated plugin window.
*   **Interactive Code Editor:** Displays generated code with syntax highlighting and theme customization.
*   **Configuration:** Plugin settings for LLM provider selection, API keys (stored securely), target language, and logging.
*   **Reasoning Model Support:** Prepended model commands for controlling reasoning models and feature toggles.
